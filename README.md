# Matrixator
Running project: https://matrixator.netlify.app/ <br>
Your go-to site when you're a freshman at university and you need to check that you calculated your determinant correctly. <br>
## Technologies
This application was built using React. I used Math.js libraries to calculate the operations between the matrices. <br>
I use reactstrap libraries for the UI.
